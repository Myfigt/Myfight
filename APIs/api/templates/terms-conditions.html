          through the MyFight services and are licensed, not sold. The method and way of

        <b class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>7. GAME RULES AND SANCTIONS FOR BREACH</span></b>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>7.1. MyFight has the right to establish the
          Game Rules for all or any particular Game. Such rules regulate (or in some case
          limit) your behavior in our Games when communicating or otherwise interacting
          with other Players. Please read out carefully the&nbsp;<b>Game Rules</b>&nbsp;available
          at&nbsp;................before playing our Games.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>7.2. When you breach the Game Rules, or
          your behavior is otherwise not consistent with them, we have the right, at our
          sole reasonable discretion, to invoke the following sanctions against you,
          depending on seriousness of your breach or inappropriate behavior and the
          stipulations of the Game Rules with regard particular violations:</span></p>
        <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
          <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>suspend your access to the "game chat"
            functionality in the Game;</span></li>
          <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>facilitate renaming of your nickname or
            editing other information of your MyFight Account, if such information
            violates Game Rules or the Terms and Conditions;</span></li>
          <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>limit the number of connections to the
            server, as well as the duration of each connection within a certain period
            of time;</span></li>
          <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>suspend or restrict your use of any of
            our Games where you violated the Games Rules;</span></li>
          <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>temporarily restrict some functionality
            of the MyFight Account;</span></li>

          <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>impose other sanctions provided by the
            Game Rules.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>7.3. Failure to comply with the Game Rules
          constitutes a material breach of the Terms and Conditions. For your information
          purposes, "Material breach" means substantial and serious violation of a
          legally binding agreement (which is the Terms and Conditions in this situation)
          that gives your contractual counterparty (which is MyFight under the Terms and
          Conditions) a lawful ground for immediate unliteral termination of such
          agreement and seeking any available remedies for such violation (which can be
          monetary ones, such as damages or compensation that you may have to reimburse).</span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>7.4. Please note if we choose to delete
          your MyFight Account, you will never be able to access it anymore. In such case
          we are also entitled to prohibit you from accessing our Games in future.</span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>7.5. MyFight independently decides on the
          fact of violation and the applicable sanctions, including, at MyFight?s sole
          discretion, by automatic means (as instance, by means of Easy Anti-Cheat
          mentioned in Section 4 above). However, you have the right to appeal MyFight?s
          decision by contacting our Customer Support Service (for more details please
          see Section 14 hereof).</span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>7.6. If you encounter another User
          violating our Game Rules, including when such violations interfere your right
          to play the Game or, you can report them via in-Game tools designed for
          reporting, or, of such tools are not available, via our Customer Support
          Service</span></p>
        <b class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>8. AGE RESTRICTIONS</span></b>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>8.1. Besides the minimum age necessary to
          accept the Terms and Conditions (including this EULA) as stipulated by the
          Terms and Conditions, please take into consideration that each Game also has
          its own age rating or limitations (e.g. PEGI, ESRB depending on your
          region).&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>8.2. Depending on your applicable law, if
          you (or your child which intends to play the Game) are under the minimum
          required age, you shall do the following:</span></p>

            legal representative whether you can play the Game;</span></li>

            of your country.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <b class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>9. HEALTH PRECAUTIONS</span></b>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>9.1. You understand and agree that Game
          audiovisual content is capable to provoke aggravating epileptic and other types
          of neurological disorders. If you have a tendency to such disorders, we
          strongly recommend you to consult your doctor before playing our Games, or
          refuse playing; MyFight is not responsible for any direct or indirect
          consequences of playing a Game in such situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>9.2. You also acknowledge that continuous
          playing can lead to excessive fatigue that is able to provoke certain diseases,
          including impaired vision, various forms of spinal deformities, neuroses and
          other health disorders. You are independently responsible for keeping track of
          the time spent while playing our Games, organizing breaks/rest, taking proper
          position while playing and undertaking other precautions to keep your health
          safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <b class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>10. SYSTEM AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</span></b>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>10.1. Please note that the requirements
          mentioned below may periodically change, including in respect of the same Game.
          It is mostly connected with the changes to the Game being made by MyFight from
          time to time according to Section 11 of this EULA. Nevertheless, MyFight also
          reserves the right to change such requirements in respect of any of the Games
          at its sole discretion.</span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>10.1.1. Minimum requirements.</span><span
      lang=EN-NZ>&nbsp;Each Game is designed for being run on one or several particular
          platforms (operating systems or devices). In some cases, a Game may have its
          own minimum technical requirements to your device (e.g. in terms of CPU, GPU,
          RAM, free storage and etc.) which are indicated by MyFight on Game?s official
          website, Game?s official page on a third party gaming platform or by other
          means at MyFight?s own discretion. Please make sure your platform meets such
          minimum requirements. Otherwise MyFight does not guarantee Game?s launch or
          functioning, and is not responsible for any errors, bugs, and other flaws in
          Game?s work. You are solely responsible for having sufficient device resources
          to store and launch the Game, including free Ram, storage, CPU and GPU load and
          etc.</span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>10.1.2. Recommended requirements.</span><span
      lang=EN-NZ>&nbsp;For informational purposes and your convenience, we usually
          publish recommended requirements of our Games with regard to the technical
          parameters of your device. Please pay attention that such recommended
          requirements are designed for information purposes only and do not guarantee
          flawless functioning of the Game, as well as do not imply any other guarantee
          or warranty. For avoidance of doubt, if a platform (whether device or operating
          system) is stated as a "recommended requirement" for a Game, it means such Game
          is designed to operate solely on such platform. Same is applicable to other
          "recommended requirements" which are clear to be necessary from the context.</span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>10.1.3. Internet connection requirement.</span><span
      lang=EN-NZ>&nbsp;Normally MyFight Games require a stable high-speed Internet
          connection in order to work correctly and provide proper gaming experience.
          Please consider that MyFight is not responsible for any flaws in Game work
          arising from the quality (including speed, reachability of MyFight servers and
          response time, or so called "ping") of your Internet connection.</span></p>
        <b class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>11. PATCHES, UPDATES AND MODIFICATIONS</span></b>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>11.1. In order to ensure best level of
          services, user experience and MyFight services efficiency within the Games, we
          need to patch, update and modify our Games from time to time. That usually results
          in mandatory and/or automatic updates of our Games, and the older versions may
          not launch or operate until you update them.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>11.2. MyFight has the right to change the
          software code of the Game at any time at its sole discretion. Such changes may
          affect, among others, the functionality of the Game and its other content. As
          instance, we can add or remove Game content or features, fix bugs and errors,
          make balance changes and etc.</span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>11.3. Please pay special attention that
          some patches, updates and modifications may require (and over the time will
          definitely require) higher technical requirements to your device, or increase
          the device resources consumption by the Game, otherwise they may lead (and over
          the time will definitely lead) to performance drop of the Game and/or lower
          graphics or other settings.</span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>11.4. By accepting this EULA, you confirm
          and acknowledge that your refusal to update the Game may make its further use
          by you impossible, and this EULA shall be deemed suspended until you update the
          Game.</span></p>
        <b class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>12. LICENSE TERMINATION</span></b>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>12.1.&nbsp;<b>Termination by User</b>. You
