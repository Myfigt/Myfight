      <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
        <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-NZ>Consent&nbsp;</span></b><span
					lang=EN-NZ>- your data is processed after receiving from you a freely
          given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent for that. To ensure
          security of your privacy laws rights, we may additionally request your
          consent for processing your data on other lawful basis (e.g. contract
          performance or legitimate interest), however, we also draw your attention
          that the withdrawal of such consent does not preclude us to process your
          data if such processing is permitted by applicable law on the other basis
          (including those mentioned right below).</span></li>

          these interests outweigh your own rights and interests.</span></li>

      <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>3.3. We specifically draw your attention

        utilized by us (or any third party upon our authorization) for any purpose,
        including our internal ones. We guarantee such databases will not contain any
        data which could be used for identifying you (personal identifiable
        information), despite the fact such data will be derived from your personal
        data and the data of other users. Likewise, we can also use your data in
        anonymized form, e.g. by the compilation other than described above, in the way
        it does not constitute your personal data after anonymizing/compilating. Before
        anonymizing, your data is used strictly as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>

        administrative security measures to ensure your data is adequately protected,

        rights can be sent to&nbsp;privacy@MyFight.net.</span></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>6.3. Please note that in some cases, in

      <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>6.6. We would like to draw your attention
        on the fact that some of the aforementioned rights may have some limitations in
        terms of their exercising due to obligations imposed on MyFight by applicable
        laws. As instance, in some cases we have to archive your data and continue to
        store it for a certain period of time (which depends on the requirements set
        forth by applicable law) even after you requested full erasure of such data.</span></p>

      <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-NZ>7.2. Please note that your refusal to
